MatPlotLib Observations:

The closer r-squared in to 1 the better fit your data is to the model. When you evaluate the average tumor size to the weight of the mouse you get an r-squared of 0.709. This means there is a strong correlation between average tumor volume and weight of the mouse.  While r-squared can tell you if correlation exist it does not take bias into account. More analysis is needed; however, you can conclude that Tumor size and weight are strongly correlated.

The drug regimen Infubinol has a potential outlier of 36.321. And needs to removed from the data set. Outliers can skew results leading to inaccurate results from your analysis. By removing the outlier your model will fit the data better.

Mouse m601 has a negative correlation and saw a reduction in tumor size over time. Since correlation does not imply cause, further analysis is need to see if being treated with Capomulin is effective in reducing the size of tumors in mice.
